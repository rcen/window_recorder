## categories
the program will log the window title that you have in focus every time you change the focussed window.
in the 'categories.dat' file you can name a string as key (left of the ':') and correspond it to a categorie  (right of the ':'). The file will be read from top to bottom. So if you use 'stackoverflow' and correspond that with the categoriey 'programming' than this will be prioritized against the string 'chrome', which might also appear on a visited website.

from 'categories.dat'
```
